# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for [Project Name]

This document specifies the non-functional requirements (NFRs) that define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

---

## 1. Performance

### NFR-PERF-001: Page Load Time
*   **Requirement:** All primary user-facing web pages must load completely (DOM content loaded + critical resources) within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection (e.g., 10 Mbps download).
*   **Metric/Verification:** Measured using browser developer tools (e.g., Lighthouse, WebPageTest) and/or Real User Monitoring (RUM). 95th percentile of load times must meet the target.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures a good user experience and reduces bounce rates.

### NFR-PERF-002: API Response Time
*   **Requirement:** Core API endpoints (e.g., login, data retrieval for main dashboard) must respond within 500ms for 99% of requests under expected load.
*   **Metric/Verification:** Load testing with tools like k6, JMeter. Monitored via APM tools.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures system responsiveness and stability.

## 2. Security

### NFR-SEC-001: Password Storage
*   **Requirement:** User passwords must be stored using a strong, adaptive, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, scrypt, or bcrypt) with a unique salt per user.
*   **Metric/Verification:** Code review, penetration testing.
*   **Rationale:** Protects user credentials from unauthorized access even if the database is compromised.

### NFR-SEC-002: Data Transmission
*   **Requirement:** All data transmitted between the client and server, especially sensitive data (PII, credentials), must be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   **Metric/Verification:** Network traffic analysis, SSL/TLS configuration checks (e.g., SSL Labs).
*   **Rationale:** Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and data sniffing.

## 3. Usability

### NFR-USABL-001: Learnability
*   **Requirement:** A new user should be able to complete core tasks (e.g., registration, primary action X) without external assistance within Y minutes during their first session.
*   **Metric/Verification:** Usability testing with representative users. Task completion rates and time-on-task.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures the system is intuitive and easy to adopt.

---

## 4. Reliability

### NFR-REL-001: System Uptime
*   **Requirement:** The system shall achieve an uptime of 99.9% (excluding scheduled maintenance).
*   **Metric/Verification:** Monitoring tools tracking availability. Incident reports.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures the system is consistently available for users.
