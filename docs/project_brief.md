# Project Brief: Notepot

## 1. Problem Statement
- Users struggle to **efficiently organize** their diverse digital notes and resources, as current methods require significant manual effort in creating and maintaining tags, folders, and other organizational structures, leading to **lost information and frustration**.
- The burden of manually categorizing and structuring notes (e.g., creating tags, folders) **consumes valuable time and mental energy** that users could otherwise dedicate to learning, creating, or acting on the information within their notes.

## 2. Proposed Solution (High-Level)
- Notepot empowers users to first efficiently organize their varied digital notes and resources through an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas, which the system automatically arranges.
- Notepot analyzes these organized materials to deliver valuable advice and information directly to the user.

## 3. Target Users / Audience
- Content Creators
- Researchers
- Students
- Professionals
- Anyone who wants to organize their notes and resources efficiently.

## 4. Key Stakeholders

  - Dependency on LLM API (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
  - Limited to recommendation system
  - Limited budget for deployment
